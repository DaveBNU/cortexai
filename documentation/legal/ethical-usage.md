Ethical guidelines and responsible practices for penetration testing with CortexAI.

## Ethical Hacking Principles

### Core Ethics

**Respect Authorization**:
- Only test systems you have permission to test
- Stay within defined scope
- Honor client restrictions
- Stop when asked

**Do No Harm**:
- Avoid destructive actions

### The Hacker Ethic

**Original Principles**:
1. Access to computers should be unlimited
2. All information should be free
3. Mistrust authority, promote decentralization
4. Hackers should be judged by their hacking
5. You can create art and beauty on a computer
6. Computers can change your life for the better

**Modern Interpretation for Security**:
- Knowledge should be shared responsibly
- Security improves when tested
- Challenge assumptions safely
- Skills should benefit society
- Innovation improves security
- Technology serves humanity

## Responsible Disclosure

### Disclosure Process

**Standard Timeline**:
1. **Day 0**: Discover vulnerability
2. **Day 1-7**: Verify and document
3. **Day 7**: Initial disclosure to vendor
4. **Day 7-90**: Vendor develops fix
5. **Day 90+**: Public disclosure (if appropriate)

**Coordinated Disclosure**:
- Contact vendor privately
- Provide technical details
- Allow reasonable fix time
- Coordinate public disclosure
- Credit researchers appropriately

### Initial Contact
