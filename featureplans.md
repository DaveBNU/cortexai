### Core Architecture & Project Management

* **Project Management Engine**
    * **Project Files:** Create a self-contained project directory and file (e.g., using a SQLite database) to store all data for a specific engagement. Upon opening of terminal running agent.js, user should be prompted whether to open a project, or start a new project. If they start a new project, they are asked to enter a project name (this would be the project working directory). Allow users to create, save, load, and close testing projects via chat.
    * **Configuration Templates:** Enable saving, configuring, and loading of project configurations (scope, authentication, etc.) for reuse.
    * **Database Viewer:** Integrate functionality to automatically launch a GUI like `sqlitebrowser` to view the project database in real-time, in the same way the audit (log) window auto opens.

* **Target Scoping & Site Mapping**
    * **Advanced Scope Definition:** Allow users to define in-scope and out-of-scope targets using URLs, regular expressions, and CIDR notation.
    * **Hierarchical Site Map:** Automatically build a tree-view representation of the target application as new assets (pages, APIs, directories) are discovered.
    * **Asset Discovery:** Implement both passive discovery (from traffic) and active discovery (crawling/spidering) to populate the site map.
    * **Content Discovery Module:** Integrate tools for finding hidden files and directories (inspired by `dirb`/`gobuster`).

* **Centralized Issue Management**
    * **Vulnerability Database:** Agent should auto log every identified vulnerability within the project file, including details like URL, parameter, severity, CWE, and evidence.
    * **Issue Tracking:** Allow users to manually add, edit, and filter findings. Track the status of each issue (e.g., New, Confirmed, False Positive, Remediated).
    * **Evidence Locker:** Automatically capture and link the exact HTTP request/response pairs that triggered a vulnerability finding.

### Advanced Scanning & Analysis

* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Engine**
    * **Passive Scanner:** Non-intrusively analyze all HTTP traffic for vulnerabilities like missing security headers, information leakage, insecure cookies, and vulnerable JavaScript libraries.
    * **Active Scanner:** Send crafted payloads to actively probe for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), OS Command Injection, and XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
    * **Scan Policy Management:** Allow users to create and customize scan policies, enabling/disabling specific vulnerability checks and adjusting sensitivity (e.g., "fast scan," "full scan," "API-only").
    * **Authenticated Scanning:** Implement robust mechanisms for handling authenticated sessions, including login forms, cookies, and bearer tokens, to test privileged areas of an application.

* **Manual Testing Toolkit**
    * **Interceptor Proxy:** Develop a full "man-in-the-middle" proxy to intercept, view, and modify HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket traffic in real-time. This is a cornerstone feature of both Burp and ZAP.
    * **Repeater Tool:** A module to manually edit and resend individual HTTP requests to analyze an endpoint's response under different conditions.
    * **Intruder/Fuzzer Tool:** A powerful, highly configurable tool for automating customized attacks. Users should be able to define payload positions and use various payload generation methods (lists, numbers, brute-force) for tasks like credential stuffing and discovering rate-limiting issues.
    * **Decoder/Encoder:** A utility for transforming data between common formats (Base64, URL, Hex, HTML, etc.).
    * **Comparer:** A visual diffing tool to compare two requests or responses, highlighting differences.

### Specialized & Next-Generation Features

* **Specialized Testing Modules**
    * **API Security Scanner:** Dedicated functionality to parse and test REST, GraphQL, and SOAP APIs. Should be able to import specifications like OpenAPI/Swagger.
    * **Session Analysis Tool (Sequencer):** A tool to analyze the randomness and predictability of session tokens, cookies, and CSRF tokens to identify session hijacking vulnerabilities.
    * **Business Logic Flaw Detection:** An AI-assisted module that attempts to understand multi-step application workflows (e.g., checkout, registration) and test for logical vulnerabilities that traditional scanners miss.
    * **JavaScript Analysis Engine:** Enhance the existing `analyze_javascript` tool to perform static analysis on client-side code to find DOM XSS, prototype pollution, and other client-side vulnerabilities.
    * **Out-of-Band Application Security Testing (OAST):** Integrate a service (like Burp Collaborator) to detect blind, asynchronous vulnerabilities (e.g., blind SSRF, blind command injection) where the result isn't returned in the immediate response.

* **Extensibility & Integration**
    * **Scripting Engine:** Allow users to write custom scripts (e.g., in Python or JavaScript) to extend the agent's functionality. This is crucial for automating bespoke tests and creating custom checks.
    * **BApp/Add-on Marketplace:** Create a framework for users to develop, share, and install add-ons that add new features, scan rules, or integrations.
    * **CI/CD Integration:** Provide a headless mode and API to allow CortexAI to be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated security testing during the development lifecycle.
    * **External Tool Integration:** Create connectors to integrate with other tools in the security ecosystem, such as Metasploit, Defect Trackers (Jira), and SIEMs.

* **Reporting & User Experience**
    * **Professional Report Generation:** Create customizable, professional-grade reports in formats like HTML and PDF, including executive summaries, detailed vulnerability descriptions, evidence, and remediation advice.
    * **AI-Assisted Remediation:** Use the underlying language model to provide context-aware, specific code examples for fixing detected vulnerabilities.
    * **Heads-Up Display (HUD):** An innovative feature like ZAP's HUD that overlays security information and tools directly into the user's browser as they navigate the target application.
    * **Collaboration:** Enable multi-user projects where team members can share findings and collaborate on a single engagement in real-time.
