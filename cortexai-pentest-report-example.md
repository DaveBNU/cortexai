### Penetration Testing Report

**Target:** https://demo.testfire.net
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Tester:** CortexAI

---

#### Findings Overview
1. **Weak Default Admin Credentials**
   - **Severity:** High
   - **Description:** The application allows login using default credentials (`admin:admin`). This indicates a weak default credential vulnerability.
   - **Evidence:** Successful login with admin credentials redirected to `/bank/main.jsp`.
   - **Remediation:** Change default credentials and enforce strong password policies.

2. **Potential Brute-Force Vulnerability**
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Description:** The application shows no rate-limiting or account lockout mechanisms on the login page, leaving it susceptible to brute-force attacks.
   - **Evidence:** Multiple login attempts without rate limiting. Only `admin:admin` was successful.
   - **Remediation:** Implement rate-limiting and account lockout mechanisms.

3. **Accessible Admin Dashboard**
   - **Severity:** High
   - **Description:** Access to the admin dashboard (`/bank/main.jsp`) was achieved using default credentials, exposing sensitive functionalities.
   - **Evidence:** Successful login and redirection to `/bank/main.jsp`.
   - **Remediation:** Restrict access using role-based access controls and session validation.

4. **Search Form Input Validation**
   - **Severity:** Info
   - **Description:** The search form resists SQL Injection attempts by sanitizing inputs and handling malicious payloads gracefully.
   - **Evidence:** No sensitive data leaked or database errors displayed.
   - **Remediation:** No remediation required.

#### Recommendations
1. **Credential Management:**
   - Enforce strong password policies.
   - Remove default credentials from the system.

2. **Authentication Security:**
   - Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.
   - Introduce CAPTCHA or MFA on the login page.

3. **Access Control:**
   - Restrict access to admin functionalities using role-based access controls.
   - Validate sessions and cookies to prevent privilege escalation.

4. **Input Validation:**
   - Continue enforcing strong input validation to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
